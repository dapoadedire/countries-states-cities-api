## Project suggestion

I struggled to get a functional API for a list of states and cities (not LGA).

If you want to practice your Go skills on a project, I’m suggesting this:

https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database

Take this repo, write a service that does the following.

1. Fetch the repo content from gh. This is because the data is updated frequently.
2. ⁠Provide an API to: fetch list of countries, list of states or regions in a country, list of cities in a state or region.

1 will be repeated every 2 weeks to fetch new data, then all cached data should be reinitialized.

For hosting, we can do with free services. I noticed some cool projects no longer have a functional API and their data is not in the repo.

If you want to work on it as a group, all interested can discuss here.
